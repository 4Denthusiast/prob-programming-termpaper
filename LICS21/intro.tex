\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Various theorems about probabilistic programs rely on the assumption that the program terminates almost surely. Proof rules based on relating the program state to supermartingales already exist for first-order imperative programs \citep{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/McIverMKK18}. This paper's contribution is to extend this method to a higher-order setting.

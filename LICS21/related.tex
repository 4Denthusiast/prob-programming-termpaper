\lo{Our results specialise to proving termination of non-random lambda calculus, which is much studied. Our approach is closest in spirit to Jones' work on size-change argument. Dal Lago's work builds on this. We think that martingales are a good framework for generalising / unifying with size-change work.}

\lo{Other approaches, mainly based on types, are complementary to ours.}

We have not yet been able to prove \Cref{conj:antitone} which would imply that \Cref{thm:antitone rankable implies termination} is almost complete.
\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:antitone}
Every term is antitone rankable if all of the terms reachable from it are AST.
\end{conjecture}

The \Cref{def:more general red} of redexes and which positions are acceptable to reduce at is sufficiently restrictive to guarantee Church-Rosserness, but is also a little more restrictive in some cases than is necessary for this purpose. For example, if the argument of a function is not yet a value, but its reduction to a value would be deterministic, or the function is affine, then applying the function before reducing its argument would not cause any problematic duplication of random samples. Similarly, if $\tsample$ occurs at position $\alpha;@_2;\beta;\lambda;\gamma$, but the function at $\alpha;@_1$ is affine, evaluatinf the $\tsample$ may in some cases also work fine. A more complete characterisation of which redexes can be reduced without breaking Church-Rosserness could be interesting.

Although this is a broadly applicable method of proving almost sure termination of probabilistic functional programs, and \Cref{thm:antitone partial implies rankable,thm:confluent ranking} make it more convenient to use, some method of automating the construction and checking of (antitone) ranking functions, even partially, could make it considerably more practically useful, especially in cases where almost sure termination is merely a side-condition for some other theorem or algorithm to be applicable.

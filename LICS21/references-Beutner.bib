  abstract = {Although probabilistic programming is widely used for some restricted classes of statistical models, existing systems lack the flexibility and efficiency needed for practical use with more challenging models arising in fields like computer vision and robotics. This paper introduces Gen, a general-purpose probabilistic programming system that achieves modeling flexibility and inference efficiency via several novel language constructs: (i) the generative function interface for encapsulating probabilistic models; (ii) interoperable modeling languages that strike different flexibility/efficiency trade-offs; (iii) combinators that exploit common patterns of conditional independence; and (iv) an inference library that empowers users to implement efficient inference algorithms at a high level of abstraction. We show that Gen outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic programming systems, sometimes by multiple orders of magnitude, on diverse problems including object tracking, estimating 3D body pose from a depth image, and inferring the structure of a time series.},

  abstract = {This document is designed to be a first-year graduate-level introduction to probabilistic programming. It not only provides a thorough background for anyone wishing to use a probabilistic programming system, but also introduces the techniques needed to design and build these systems. It is aimed at people who have an undergraduate-level understanding of either or, ideally, both probabilistic machine learning and programming languages. We start with a discussion of model-based reasoning and explain why conditioning as a foundational computation is central to the fields of probabilistic machine learning and artificial intelligence. We then introduce a simple first-order probabilistic programming language (PPL) whose programs define static-computation-graph, finite-variable-cardinality models. In the context of this restricted PPL we introduce fundamental inference algorithms and describe how they can be implemented in the context of models denoted by probabilistic programs. In the second part of this document, we introduce a higher-order probabilistic programming language, with a functionality analogous to that of established programming languages. This affords the opportunity to define models with dynamic computation graphs, at the cost of requiring inference methods that generate samples by repeatedly executing the program. Foundational inference algorithms for this kind of probabilistic programming language are explained in the context of an interface between program executions and an inference controller. This document closes with a chapter on advanced topics which we believe to be, at the time of writing, interesting directions for probabilistic programming research; directions that point towards a tight integration with deep neural network research and the development of systems for next-generation artificial intelligence applications.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Imagine a world where computational simulations can be inverted as easily as running them forwards, where data can be used to refine models automatically, and where the only expertise one needs to carry out powerful statistical analysis is a basic proficiency in scientific coding. Creating such a world is the ambitious long-term aim of {$<$}em{$>$}probabilistic programming{$<$}/em{$>$}. {$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The bottleneck for improving the probabilistic models, or simulators, used throughout the quantitative sciences, is often not an ability to devise better models conceptually, but a lack of expertise, time, or resources to realize such innovations. Probabilistic programming systems (PPSs) help alleviate this bottleneck by providing an expressive and accessible modeling framework, then automating the required computation to draw inferences from the model, for example finding the model parameters likely to give rise to a certain output. By decoupling model specification and inference, PPSs streamline the process of developing and drawing inferences from new models, while opening up powerful statistical methods to non-experts. Many systems further provide the flexibility to write new and exciting models which would be hard, or even impossible, to convey using conventional statistical frameworks.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The central goal of this thesis is to improve and extend PPSs. In particular, we will make advancements to the underlying inference engines and increase the range of problems which can be tackled. For example, we will extend PPSs to a mixed inference-optimization framework, thereby providing automation of tasks such as model learning and engineering design. Meanwhile, we make inroads into constructing systems for automating adaptive sequential design problems, providing potential applications across the sciences. Furthermore, the contributions of the work reach far beyond probabilistic programming, as achieving our goal will require us to make advancements in a number of related fields such as particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, Bayesian optimization, and Monte Carlo fundamentals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
